BACKGROUND IMAGE REQUIRED
========================

This child theme requires a constitutional parchment background image to be placed in this directory.

Required file name: parchment-background.jpg

Image specifications:
- Format: JPG or WebP
- Minimum dimensions: 1920x1080px  
- Recommended file size: Under 500KB (optimized for web)
- Style: Constitutional parchment, aged paper, or legal document texture
- Quality: High resolution for sharp display on all devices

Where to find suitable images:
- Stock photo sites (Shutterstock, Getty Images, Adobe Stock)
- Free resources (Unsplash, Pexels) - search for "parchment", "constitution", "aged paper"
- Government archives for actual constitutional document textures
- Legal document templates

Once you have the image:
1. Name it exactly: parchment-background.jpg
2. Place it in this directory: /wp-content/themes/twentytwentyfive-child/
3. The CSS is already configured to use this image

The theme will work without this image (white background fallback), but the parchment background is essential for the professional legal aesthetic specified in the project requirements.
